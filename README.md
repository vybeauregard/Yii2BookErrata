# Yii2BookErrata
An attempt to log and provide workarounds for omissions, assumptions, and other less-than-clear instructions in "Web Application Development with Yii2 and PHP"

## Chapter 1

No code is written in the chapter, as it covers configuring your dev environment.

## [Chapter 2](Chapter-2.md)
This chapter is critical, as it is the basis for the rest of the exercises in the book. 

## [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.md)

We are continuing to build upon the CRM app we started on in Chapter 2. Most of the issues resolved in that stage of development should carry through to this chapter.
