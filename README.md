# Yii2BookErrata
An attempt to log and provide workarounds for omissions, assumptions, and other less-than-clear instructions in "Web Application Development with Yii2 and PHP"

## Chapter 1

No code is written in the chapter, as it covers configuring your dev environment.

## [Chapter 2](Chapter-2.md)
This chapter is critical, as it is the basis for the rest of the exercises in the book. 

## [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.md)

We are continuing to build upon the CRM app we started on in Chapter 2. Most of the issues resolved in that stage of development should carry through to this chapter.

## [Chapter 4](Chapter-4.md)

This chapter takes a look at Yii under the hood and the path that is followed to take page content and render it for the client. The first half of this chapter is theoretical in nature, but it is helpful to get `Yii::app` to spit out some of its properties to see how its various settings are applied.

Later, we'll be adding a theme. That's when the fun starts!
