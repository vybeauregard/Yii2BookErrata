If you prefer, you can [download the code bundle](Chapter-3.md#page-74) included with the book and deploy the vagrant virtual machine, which has everything pre-configured.\r\n\r\n## [Chapter 2](Chapter-2.md)\r\nThis chapter is critical, as it is the basis for the rest of the exercises in the book. \r\n\r\n## [Chapter 3](Chapter-3.md)\r\n\r\nWe are continuing to build upon the CRM app we started on in Chapter 2. Most of the issues resolved in that stage of development should carry through to this chapter.\r\n\r\n## [Chapter 4](Chapter-4.md)\r\n\r\nThis chapter takes a look at Yii under the hood and the path that is followed to take page content and render it for the client. The first half of this chapter is theoretical in nature, but it is helpful to get `Yii::app` to spit out some of its properties to see how its various settings are applied.\r\n\r\nLater, we'll be adding a theme. That's when the fun starts!\r\n\r\n## [Chapter 5](Chapter-5.md)\r\n\r\nThis chapter delves into practical examples, starting with User Authentication\r\n\r\n>This may be abandoned for a bit. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
